           <p> Come enjoy Asian barbecued meat in the lively Roppongi area. At Nikugen, meat is everything. The beef is carefully selected and wet-aged for over 30 days to give diners the tastiest experience. The wet-aging process allows the meat to get more flavourful and tender. The star of Nikugen is the Black Angus beef. If you are not familiar with this beef, you should know that it is the breed that develops better marbling than most cattle. The marbling is known to keep the meat moist while cooking. If this didn’t not seduce you, the wine selection surely will. A wine cellar awaits at the entrance of the restaurant with over 60 varieties.</p>
           <p>The open interior with snug sofas, pillows, bench seats and contemporary paintings all over the restaurant are the perfect ambiance for a relaxing, chic dining experience suitable for any occasion. Make sure to visit Nikugen for a delicious wining and dining time.
