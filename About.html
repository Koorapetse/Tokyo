       <p>Yuriko Koike (小池 百合子, Koike Yuriko, born 15 July 1952) is a Japanese politician who currently serves as the Governor of Tokyo. She graduated from the American University in Cairo (B.A. in Sociology) as the top student in 1976 and was a member of the House of Representatives of Japan from 1993 until 2016, when she resigned to run in the Tokyo gubernatorial election, and was previously the Minister of Defense in the first cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, but resigned in August 2007 after only 54 days in office. On 31 July 2016, Koike was elected Governor of Tokyo, the city's first female Governor. Koike was re-elected Governor of Tokyo on 5 July 2020 in a landslide, winning 59.7% of the vote.</p>
       <p>Born and raised in Ashiya, Hyōgo, a wealthy, small, city near Kobe, Koike went to Kōnan Girls' Junior and Senior High School for her secondary education. Her father, Yūjirō Koike, was a foreign trade merchant who handled oil products. He was also involved in politics, supporting Shintarō Ishihara and the Tatenokai in the 1960s, and ran unsuccessfully for national election in 1969. Yūjirō emphasised to Yuriko that it was essential for Japan to strengthen relations with Arab countries to ensure a stable petroleum supply to prevent Japan being thrust into an oil war again the future. After dropping out of Kwansei Gakuin University's School of Sociology in September 1971, she went on to study Arabic at the American University in Cairo and received a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology as the top student from Cairo University in October 1976. When she was 21, she married a fellow Japanese student but divorced soon after. She began to work as an interpreter of Arabic and later became a journalist, interviewing Muammar Gaddafi and Yasser Arafat in 1978, and becoming a news anchor in 1979. She received the Female Broadcaster of Japan award in 1990.</p>

       <h3 class="Career">Career in politics</h3>
       <br>
       <p>Koike was elected to the House of Councilors in 1992 as a member of the New Japan Party. She was then elected to the House of Representatives in 1993, representing Hyogo District 2. Hyogo District 6 of the New Frontier Party. She won this seat as a New Conservative Party candidate in the 2000 elections. She joined the Liberal Democratic Party in 2002. Since 2010, she has also been a regular contributor to Project Syndicate.</p>
       <p>She served as the Minister of the Environment and Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Jun'ichirō Koizumi. Along with Satsuki Katayama and Makiko Fujino, Koike became known as one of Koizumi's "assassins" in the 2005 Lower House election, running in Tokyo against an LDP hardliner candidate who opposed Koizumi's policies.</p>
       <p>She was appointed the first female Minister of Defense in June 2007 during the first term of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, but announced in August 2007 that she intended to resign from the post, citing the Aegis classified information leak scandal as a reason. Koike later hinted that the much-publicized fight she had had with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki over a vice-minister replacement was the real reason, as the opposition would use that to oppose a bill on Japan's terrorism laws.</p>
       <p>On September 8, 2008, she began running for the chairmanship of the Liberal Democratic Party and became the first woman in Japanese history to seek the post of prime minister: "I have the enthusiastic support of my colleagues. Stagnation in the face of Japanese society, I think this country is not as good as it is. There is a candidate. Hillary used the term "glass ceiling" ... But in Japan, it is not glass, but an iron plate. I do not I am a wife. In the leader election held on September 22, Taro Aso won with 351 votes out of 527, Taro Koike won third place with 46 votes.</p>
       <p>Following the resignation of Tokyo Governor Naoki Inose in December 2013, there were rumors that Koike, along with Higashikunihara Hideo, Shimomura Hakufumi, Hashimoto Seiko, and Suu Yoichi, were expected to be potential candidates for the scheduled governor election. February 2014. She did not race in the end, Masuzoe won.</p>
       <p>After Masuzoe announced his resignation in June 2016, Koike announced her intention to run in the election for his successor. Koike stated that she would run "as an LDP lawmaker" but did not obtain the approval of the Tokyo LDP chapter before announcing her candidacy. The LDP officially endorsed Hiroya Masuda, and its Tokyo chapter issued a notice that any members supporting Koike would be punished. Nonetheless, several prominent LDP politicians continued to back Koike, while senior leaders such as Shinzo Abe refrained from making speeches in support of either candidate.</p>
       <p>Koike was elected Governor of Tokyo on July 31, 2016, becoming the first woman in office . 
        On August 21, 2016, at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics, Koike passed Thomas Bach from Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes takes the Olympic flag. 
        On May 31, 2017, before the next local election, Koike resigned from the Liberal Democratic Party and officially became the leader of the Eastminster First Association (Tokyo People First). Koike established the organization in 2016 to prepare for the elections and form an alliance with the Komeito to ensure a majority of seats in the Tokyo parliament. On July 3, 2017, the coalition won a majority in the county election and expelled the Liberal Democratic Party from the 127-seat parliament with 79 seats.</p>
       <p>Koike ran her platform based on seven zeros, which were basically socio-economic problems faced by residents of Tokyo. Out of these goals, she was able to reduce the number of children on the waitlist to get admission in day care and cutting down the number of euthanized dogs and cats. However, critics say other issues like tackling the overwork culture, reducing crowding on rush hour trains, and getting rid of above-ground electricity poles have not yet been achieved.</p>

          <h1>History of Tokyo</h1>
          <img src="Images/history01.jpg" alt="Ginza 4-chome Crossing (1955)">
          <img src="Images/history02.jpg" alt="Ginza 4-chome Crossing">
          <p>The history of Tokyo can be traced back to about 400 years ago. Edo was originally known as Edo. In 1603, Ieyasu Tokugawa established the Tokugawa Shogunate here and began to prosper. As the center of Japanese politics and culture, Edo developed into a large city with a population of over one million in the mid-18th century. During this period, the Emperor lived in Kyoto, which was the official capital of the country. The Edo period lasted for nearly 260 years until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate, and the restoration of imperial power. The emperor moved to Edo, and Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo thus became the capital of Japan.</p>
          <p>In the Meiji era (1868-1912), Japan began a fanatical assimilation of Western civilization. Stone brick buildings were built on the site of the feudal lord's mansion and the main road was paved with cobblestones. Japan's first telecommunications line was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1869, and the first steam locomotive began operating in 1872 from Shimbashi to Yokohama. Western-style hairstyles have replaced traditional men's bows, and bowlers, high collars, and skirts have become fashionable at the heights. In 1882, Japan's first zoo was opened in Ueno. In 1885, the government cabinet system was approved and Ito Hirobumi became the first prime minister of Japan. With the promulgation of the Constitution of the Great Empire of Japan in 1889, Japan established the political system of a modern country.</p>
          <p>In September 1923, Tokyo was damaged by the Great Kanto Earthquake. The fire caused by the earthquake razed the city center to the ground. More than 140,000 people were reportedly killed or disappeared and 300,000 houses were destroyed. After the earthquake, a city reconstruction plan was drawn up, but because the estimated cost exceeded the national budget, only a small part of it was carried out.</p>
          <p>During the Taisho era (1912-1926), the number of people working in cities increased, and a growing proportion of citizens began to lead consumer lifestyles. Educational standards improved, and the number of girls going on to study at higher schools increased. Performing arts such as theater and opera thrived.</p>
          <p>Soon after the Great Kanto Earthquake, the Showa Period (1926-1989) began to be in a state of grief. Even so, Japan's first subway line between Asakusa and Ueno was opened in 1927, and the 16th House of Representatives elections in 1928 were held for the first time after the implementation of male universal suffrage. Tokyo Haneda Airport was completed in 1931, and Tokyo Port was opened in 1941. By 1935, the permanent population of Tokyo had increased to 6.36 million, which was comparable to the populations of New York and London.</p>
          <p>However, the War of the Pacific that broke out in 1941 had a great impact on Tokyo. In 1943, for reasons of wartime efficiency, the dual administrative system of the prefecture (county) of Tokyo and the city (city) of Tokyo was abolished, and the prefecture and the city were merged into Tokyo. This established the metropolitan administrative system and appointed the governor. In the final stage of the war, Tokyo was bombed 102 times. The most serious air attack occurred on March 10, 1945, causing heavy casualties and material losses. The war ended on September 2, 1945, and the Japanese government and military representatives signed a letter of surrender. Most of Tokyo was destroyed by bombing. By October 1945, the population had dropped to 3.49 million, half of the 1940 level.</p>
          <p>In May 1947, the new Constitution of Japan and the Local Self-Government Law came into force, and Seiichiro Yasui was elected the first governor of Tokyo by popular vote under the new system. In August of the same year, Tokyo began implementing the current 23 special districts. system.</p>
          <p>The 1950s was a period of gradual recovery of the country. Television broadcasting began in 1953, and Japan joined the United Nations in 1956. Especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the boom in special acquisitions was conducive to economic recovery. This prompted Japan to enter a period of rapid development. In the 1960s, due to technological innovation and the introduction of new industries and new technologies, synthetic fibers and household appliances such as televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines began to be mass-produced. As a result, the daily lives of Tokyo residents have undergone tremendous changes. In 1962, Tokyo's population exceeded the 10 million mark. In the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the Shinkansen ("bullet train") began operation and the capital expressway was opened, laying the foundation for Tokyo's current prosperity.</p>
          <p>In the 1970s, the country was hit by environmental problems like air and river pollution and high noise levels, and pressure for rapid economic growth became apparent. The 1973 oil crisis halted years of rapid economic growth.</p>
          <p>In the 1980s, Tokyo took a big step in economic growth due to its increasingly globalized economic activities and the emergence of an information society. Tokyo has become one of the most active major cities in the world, with state-of-the-art technology, information, culture and fashion appeal, as well as a high level of public safety. Since 1986, land and stock prices have spiraled up, a phenomenon known as the "bubble economy."</p>
          <p>Japan has achieved tremendous growth under the bubble economy, but with the bursting of the bubble in the early 1990s, the long-term economic recession led to a decline in tax revenues, which put metropolitan finances in a critical state. However, Tokyo has overcome this financial crisis through two consecutive fiscal reconstruction plans. The population has also begun to return to Tokyo. In 1997, the number of immigrants exceeded the number of immigrants for the first time in 12 years. The population of Tokyo reached 12 million in 2001 and exceeded 13 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake shook the Tohoku region and Tokyo was also severely affected. Tokyo is using the experience gained from this disaster to further strengthen its crisis management system.</p>
          <p>In September 2013, Tokyo was selected as the venue for the second Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020. In order to make the 2020 Olympics the best Olympics in history and leave a valuable legacy for the future, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is working hard to promote tangible measures and intangible assets, including infrastructure improvements. , Environmental measures and cultural promotion.</p>
          <p>The population of Tokyo is expected to begin to decline after reaching its peak in 2020. At the same time, taking into account the changes in the social structure such as the aging of the population, Tokyo is moving towards the goal of becoming the best city to strike a balance between economic wealth and quality of life, so that anyone can fully enjoy life.</p>
