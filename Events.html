         <p>The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020年夏季オリンピック, Hepburn: Nisen Nijū-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad (第三十二回オリンピック競技大会, Dai Sanjūni-kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai) and branded as Tokyo 2020 (東京2020), is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to be held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and will be held largely behind closed doors with no spectators permitted under the state of emergency. Despite being rescheduled for 2021, the event retains the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. This is the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed and rescheduled, rather than cancelled. The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days after the Olympics.</p>

            <h3>Oji Fox Parade (Kitsune no Gyoretsu)</h3>
            <p>According to old legends, before there was any city where Tokyo now stands, foxes from all over the region would gather underneath a large tree on New Year's Eve. The foxes would don costumes and then parade to Oji Inari Shrine. In honor of that, famous ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige created a print called "New Year's Eve Foxfires at the Changing Tree, Oji." The Oji Fox Parade was established in 1993 as a modern-day, living recreation of the print. It has also been a way for residents of Oji to look back on the previous year while welcoming the new one.</p>
            <p>At this annual celebration of traditional Oji culture, participants dress up as foxes for a special procession that starts at night on December 31st. They hold paper lanterns, which not only represent foxfires, but also the light of hope and life. The lively procession ends past midnight on January 1st with a solemn blessing at the Oji Inari Shrine, where participants celebrate their first shrine visit of the year. Visit Oji to see this unique local tradition for yourself.</p>

            <h3>Mokojima-Hyakkaen gardens</h3>
            <p>Mukojima Hyakkaen is a small, historical strolling garden in the Mukojima district of Sumida ward in north-eastern Tokyo. This garden, more than a century old, is closely associated with the arts and literature, and is a must-see for aficionados of natural-style Japanese landscaping.</p>
            <p>Mukojima Hyakkaen is distinguished by being Tokyo's only surviving garden from the Edo period of Japanese history. The park was the dreamchild of an antiques dealer, Sahara Kikuu, who, during the first three decades of the 19th century and with the help of fellow art and nature lovers, established an enchanting landscaped orchard here of 360 plum (ume) trees, creating a springtime blossom extravaganza.</p>
